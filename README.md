## Steps

- Once you clone this repo, use ```npm install``` to download and install all the required node modules. 
- Then, open the terminal and run ```ng serve``` start the angular server. By default, it will start on port 4200
```
http://localhost:4200/
```
- Parallely, on another terminal, run ```npm run server``` which will start the dummy server which in turn enables us to mimic some APIs. By default, it will run on port 3004
```
http://localhost:3004
```
- Now, you can perform basic CRUD operations using the application.

## Scope for improvement

- Understanding and Implementing a toggle button functionality to show and close the 'Add Task' form by implementing a UIService.
